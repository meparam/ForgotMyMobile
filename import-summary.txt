ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Old Build Tools:
----------------
The version of the build tools installed with your SDK is old. It
should be at least version 19.0.1 to work well with the Gradle build
system. To update it, open the Android SDK Manager, and install the
highest available version of Tools > Android SDK Build-tools.

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
